# [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) Projects
This repository consists of the projects completed through DataCamp, a data science e-learning platform, which can be accessed via the link above. If you have an interest in learning data science, it is a highly valuable and accessible resource. The information contained in this repository is for personal and professional reference and is no substitute for the wealth of knowledge attained from completing the projects for oneself. Each file is formatted as a Jupyter Notebook.

DataCamp projects, for those unfamiliar, function similarly to the course exercises in that the challenge is to write code which will meet set expectations, complete given tasks, and function properly. All other information, opinions, and insights are provided by the project's original designer as no editing to the markdown cells has been made.

For an example of additional data visualization proficiency as well as some regular expression and functional programming, please see [*Degrees That Pay You Back*](https://github.com/Delimain/DataCamp_Projects/blob/master/Degrees%20That%20Pay%20You%20Back/notebook.ipynb).
